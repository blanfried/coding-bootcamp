# Window objects

## But first, this

- Update your instructor repository

cd
cd ~/coding_bootcamp/instructor
git reset --hard
git pull

```

# Events

- What is an event?

- Open [11-Ins_Event-Listener/index.html](../activities/11-Ins_Event-Listener/index.html) in live server
- Open [11-Ins_Event-Listener/assets/js/script.js](../activities/11-Ins_Event-Listener/assets/js/script.js) and explain how it works

- Might be worth pointing out that the slider is completely CSS.

## Try this

Try [12-Stu_Event-Listener/README.md](../activities/12-Stu_Event-Listener/README.md)
