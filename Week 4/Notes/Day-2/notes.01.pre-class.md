# Little live exercise

Allow yourself around 15 minutes to try this. Feel free to try this in pairs or larger groups.

I may well ask someone to volunteer a live coding session.

Write a function that takes in an integer and outputs the sum of all the numbers from 1 to that integer.

Examples:
```
Input: 2
Output: 3 (because 1 + 2 = 3)

Input: 4
Output: 10  (because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10)

Input: 10
Output: 55
```

```
const sum = (number) => {
    // TODO
}
```

or

```

const sum = (number) => {
    let result = 0
}

function sum(number) {
    for (let i = 0; i => 5; i++) {
       }
}
```
