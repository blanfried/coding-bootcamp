# Little live exercise

Allow yourself around 15 minutes to try this. Feel free to try this in pairs or larger groups.

I may well ask someone to volunteer a live coding session.

Write a function that takes in an integer and outputs the max number in the array

Examples:

```
Input: [ 1, 2, 3 ]
Output: 3

Input: [ 3, 6, 4, 5, 2, 1 ]
Output: 6

Input: [ 3, 3, 3 ]
Output: 3

```

```
Remember num will a array input
const max = (num) => {
    // TODO
}
```

or

```
function max(num) {
    // TODO
}
```
