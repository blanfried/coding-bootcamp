# Sessions

## Demo

- Open [15-Ins_Sessions](../../01-Activities/15-Ins_Sessions/) and run
  - Note [server.js](../../01-Activities/15-Ins_Sessions/server.js) brings in session
  - Note the session middleware
  - Explain what a cookie is
  - Why do websites ask you to allow cookies?
  - Note [home-routes.js](../../01-Activities/15-Ins_Sessions/controllers/home-routes.js) and how it uses the session to store the `countVisit`
  - Compare cookies vs local storage
    - Cookies are max 4KB, local storage is 5MB
    - `localStorage` stays on the client, while cookies are sent with the HTTP header to the Server
