# Binary search

## Demo

- Open [25-Ins_Binary-Search/binary-search.md](../../01-Activities/25-Ins_Binary-Search/binary-search.md)
  - Sorting algorithms to learn about [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm)
- Open [27-Evr_Shell/README.md](../../01-Activities/27-Evr_Shell/README.md)
  - Make your terminal nice!
    - Windows
      - You could use [Powerline for git bash](https://github.com/diesire/git_bash_windows_powerline)
      - You could probably do a lot more if you use the [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) version of bash (which is running Linux under the bonnet). You can then use the recommendations below
      - [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) used to be good: This _might_ open up some of the Unix options below
    - macos/Linux
      - Zsh is used by default on macos. Easy to install on Linux. It is backwards compatible with bash (in technobabble, it is [POSIX](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/what-is-posix-shell/) compliant)
      - [Oh My ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/)
      - I use [Fish](https://fishshell.com/). Lovely, but sometimes not compatible with bash scripts.
