# useEffect

## Demo

- Open [17-Ins_Hooks-useEffect/src](../../01-Activities/17-Ins_Hooks-useEffect/src)
  - Open `Display`
  - React `useEffect` is only applicable to functional components (why?)
  - `useEffect` is triggered when you update the state
  - You can pass an optional array of states to watch (including [], so that it triggers only once)
  - Demonstrate when it is called with a `console.log`

## Try

- Try [18-Stu_Hooks-useEffect/README.md](../../01-Activities/18-Stu_Hooks-useEffect/README.md)
