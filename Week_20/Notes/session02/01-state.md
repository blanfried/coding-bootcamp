# React State

## Demo

- Open [swap_tool](../../01-Activities/swap_tool)
  - Run it, and see what happens
- Use `sswap` to copy [11-Ins_State/src](../../01-Activities/11-Ins_State/src) over and run
  - Open `Greeting.js`
    - Note the `useState` hook, and the deconstructed state and setter
    - The value of `greeting` is remembered between re-renders
    - The argument that `useState` accepts is the initial value of the state variable
    - The value of `greeting` can be used just like any other variable

## Try

- Try [12-Stu_State/README.md](../../01-Activities/12-Stu_State/README.md)
