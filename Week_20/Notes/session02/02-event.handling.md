# Event Handling

## Demo

- Open [13-Ins_Event-Handling/src/](../../01-Activities/13-Ins_Event-Handling/src)
  - Look at `Counter.js`
  - Look at `handleClick` and how it updates the count
    - Updating the `state` variable itself does not update the actual state, just a copy, and doesn't force a re-render
  - Look at how `handleClick` is wired into the button

## Try

- Try [14-Stu_Event-Handling/README.md](../../01-Activities/14-Stu_Event-Handling/README.md)
