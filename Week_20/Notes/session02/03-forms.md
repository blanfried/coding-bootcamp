# Forms

## Demo

- Open [15-Ins_React-Forms/src](../../01-Activities/15-Ins_React-Forms/src)
  - Look at the `Form` component
    - Not a single file
    - Has its own CSS file that only applies to the `Form` component
    - Two `onChange` events are handled using `handleInputChange`
    - `handleFormSubmit` doesn't need the `preventDefault` method to be called: React deals with that for you

## Try

- Try [16-Stu_React-Forms/README.md](../../01-Activities/16-Stu_React-Forms)
