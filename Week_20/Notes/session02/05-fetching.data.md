# Fectching data

## Demo

- Open [19-Ins_Fetching-Data/src](../../01-Activities/19-Ins_Fetching-Data/src)
  - Look at `SearchResultContainer.js`
  - `useEffect` only runs once, and is used to fetch data
  - Compare `componentDidMount` in the lifecycle method (see [here](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_lifecycle.asp) for a list of lifecycle methods)
  - What makes the results render?
  - `SearchResultContainer` is _stateful_ (explain what this means)
  - Look at `API.js` and look at the `search` method
    - What is `axios`?
    - How can we make our component refresh after every change to the search term?
