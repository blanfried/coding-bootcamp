# React Style

## Demo

- Open [21-Ins_React-Style/src](../../01-Activities/21-Ins_React-Style/src)

  - Look at `Header.js`
  - Look at the CSS that we are importing
  - Look at `Navbar.js` and its `styles` object
  - Note:
    - `className` not `class` (why?)
    - `camelCase` not `kebab-case` for properties (why?)
  - Look at `Card.js` and its `styles` object

  - There are other ways of styling components in react. Sass, Less, Styled Components etc.

## Try

- Try [22-Stu_React-Style/README.md](../../01-Activities/22-Stu_React-Style/README.md)
