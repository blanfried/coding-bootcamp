# Conditional rendering

## Demo

- Open [23-Ins_Conditional-Rendering/src](../../01-Activities/23-Ins_Conditional-Rendering/src)
  - Look at `App.js`
    - Sets the original state
    - Generally, state is defined in the top level component, and cascaded down to othere elements (why?)
  - Look at `Welcome`
    - Functional component
    - Note the direct exporting
    - Note how properties are deconstructed
    - Note the conditional rendering ternary. We have to use a ternary because `if` statements aren't allowed to be embedded in XML code

## Try

- Try [24-Stu_Conditional-Rendering/README.md](../../01-Activities/24-Stu_Conditional-Rendering/README.md)
