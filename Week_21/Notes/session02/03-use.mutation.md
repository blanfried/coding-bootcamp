# useMutation

## Demo

- Open [15-Ins_useMutation](../../01-Activities/15-Ins_useMutation)
  - `install`, `seed`, `develop`
  - Pretty similar pattern, but with mutations
  - Note the variable in the `addProfile` mutation, making our mutation reusable
  - `window.location.reload()` is a bit of a hack, but it works for the moment

## Try

- Try [16-Stu_useMutation/README.md](../../01-Activities/16-Stu_useMutation/README.md)
